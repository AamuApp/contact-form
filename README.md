# contact-form

A sample contact form to conntect into your Aamu.app database.

## Instructions

1. First, setup the forms in your Aamu.app database (Database settings/Forms).
2. Then, deploy to Netlify:

    (You can also use GitHub Pages, or any hosting really, but you would need to do that manually.)
    
3. Then, go to your repository, which Netlify created, and edit `index.html` and change the form endpoint (action). You will find this endpoint in your database settings (that you did earlier).
